Today I returned to Cambridge, only one rowing outing for today. Tomorrow I've got to sort out laundry, work out my CFA scheduling, do 1 pre-lecture, maybe tutor for an hour, linked-in one person and do one finance application.

General:
Bring laundry bucket, suit, posters, eating and cooking utensils

I am grateful for having my mother's 2004 CV on my wall, it reminds me that we all started somewhere.

I want to be more connected to the people around me, in my course, in my college, in my social life.
I want to be better prepared for the coming year at Cambridge and my CFA exam.
I want to nail this season of internship applications.
All three of these are doable. Today we did a little towards this, tomorrow we will do some more.
