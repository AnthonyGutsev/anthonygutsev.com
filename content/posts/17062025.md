This is my second day of writing. My schedule for the day included waking up late after a PE recruitment
talk, getting my hair cut, tutoring for 2.5 hours, a rowing outing (the last one pre-bumps!), then rushing
to get to a networking event in London. I will be showing up very late, hopefully will still make
something of it. I planned on doing some off-cycle applications today, I doubt I will have
much time, will try and get one done on the train. The Bristol Tracker will become one of my coming
year's holy texts I am sure.

I want to write something on a couple topics in finance. In future something more in depth will appear 
here for each of these. Here is a provisional list for now:
# Topics: 
- Economy and political landscape in Kazakhstan
- Economy and political landscape in Russia
- Economy and political landscape in Germany

- Historical piece on the Fed and interest rates
- The offshore dollar market
- The Gold Standard
