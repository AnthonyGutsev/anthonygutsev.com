Technically posted after midnight, but keeping a streak is more important than exact hours. It's before midnight somewhere.

Bumped into a Cambridge friend, failed to buy myself trousers, got a second bump in two days, avoided crashing out at our cox, videocalled Westminster friends, booked family flights. Suboptimal use of Avios was slightly embarrassing. 

The takeaway from today is to be more engaged in friendships. It's true that I get a lot of social slack, I can hold myself to higher (normal) standards, and should expect to be treated as such.

Further embarrassment, applications and PE videos are behind schedule. Baby steps tomorrow.
