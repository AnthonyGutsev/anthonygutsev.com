Today I returned to Cambridge, only one rowing outing for today. Tomorrow I've got to sort out laundry, work out my CFA scheduling, do 1 pre-lecture, maybe tutor for an hour, linked-in one person and do one finance application.

General:
Bring laundry bucket, suit, posters, eating and cooking utensils
